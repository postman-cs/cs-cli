# Finance Industry & Sammons Financial Research Report
*Research conducted: September 12, 2025*
*Focus period: Last 24 months with historical context*

## Executive Summary

The finance industry is undergoing transformative change driven by four macro forces: **regulatory compliance modernization**, **cost optimization pressures**, **AI-driven automation adoption**, and **sustainability mandates**. **ISO 20022 implementation (completing November 2025) represents the industry's largest API standardization initiative**, creating opportunities for comprehensive API lifecycle management solutions.

**Sammons Financial Group, an employee-owned insurance conglomerate headquartered in West Des Moines, Iowa, operates primarily in life insurance and annuities markets**. Current technology infrastructure includes **Salesforce with extensive API integrations** to Marketlink API and Discovery Data lake systems¹. Job postings reveal focus on **QA automation, DevOps practices, and API testing tools including Postman**.

**Key AI opportunities center on fraud detection, predictive analytics for risk assessment, and customer service automation**. However, **regulatory complexity (PSD2/PSD3, GDPR, CCPA) creates substantial compliance overhead** for API implementations.

**For Postman specifically**: The BFSI sector represents **28.8% of the $19.28 billion API management market by 2030**². Sammons Financial's current Salesforce-centric architecture and automation focus suggest strong fit for **API design, testing, collaboration, and governance tools**. **Primary opportunity lies in modernizing API lifecycle management** as they expand digital services and comply with evolving insurance regulations.

**Critical insight**: Finance firms prioritize **security-first API strategies** with built-in compliance frameworks rather than feature-rich but compliance-ambiguous solutions.
